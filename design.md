# openpreflight design system

## Overview

openpreflight is a **small self-hosted CI provider** for private GitHub repos: one Go binary,
one SQLite file, one Check Run per commit. The sites should feel like a finished developer
product, with calm forest greens, warm olive neutrals, and monospace for program output.
It should not read as a startup pitch deck.

**Key characteristics**

- Forest green accent (`#2f6f4f` / `#7cc79c` dark), never purple, never cool SaaS blue as the brand.
- Inter for UI and display; **JetBrains Mono** for kickers, code, and the Check Run panel.
- Soft olive-tinted ground (`#f7f8f5` / `#121412`), not pure white or stark cold gray.
- Elevation via hairline borders and light atmospheric bloom, never heavy multi-layer shadows or glow.
- Copy is technical and specific; no fabricated customer logos, fake stats, or invented pricing tiers.

## Brand voice

- Short, concrete sentences. Name the mechanism (HMAC, Check Run, SQLite, GitHub App).
- Prefer "what it does" over "transform your workflow".
- The wordmark is lowercase: **openpreflight**.

## Mark / favicon

The mark is a **runway-check** on forest green: a checkstroke that finishes as a short runway,
with a caret at the apex (preflight / takeoff). Favicon and apple-touch use the mark only.
Starlight/docs may show mark + title text separately.

## Website (marketing)

- First viewport: brand, one headline, one supporting line, one CTA group, one product visual
  (Check Run panel or adapted dashboard preview that still reads as openpreflight).
- Use Rivelle `saas-landing-01` structure for production polish, but **replace placeholder SaaS
  copy** with real openpreflight positioning. Drop or rewrite pricing / testimonial blocks that
  invent customers or paid plans the product does not have.
- Keep accessibility: skip link, `<main>`, `:focus-visible`, labelled navs, reduced motion.

## Docs (Starlight)

- Inherit the same accent and mark; do not invent a second palette.
- Per-page meta descriptions; logo light/dark pair without `currentColor` in `<img>` SVGs.

## Do

- Lead with the Check Run as the product surface.
- Link out to docs for how-to; keep the marketing page to positioning and proof.
- Match contrast: text AA; control borders ≥ 3:1 against ground (`edge-strong`).

## Don't

- Don't use Inter-only pages with no mono voice. The product is terminal-adjacent.
- Don't put cards, stats strips, or logo clouds in the hero.
- Don't introduce a second accent (coral, violet, electric blue) for "interest".
- Don't fabricate testimonials, pricing, or "used by" logos.
